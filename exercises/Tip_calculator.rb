=begin 

Create a simple tip calculator. The program should prompt for a bill amount and a tip rate. The program must compute the tip and then display both the tip and the total amount of the bill.

Example:

What is the bill? 200
What is the tip percentage? 15

The tip is $30.0
The total is $230.0

=end

puts "What is the bill?"
bill = gets.chomp.to_f.round(2)
